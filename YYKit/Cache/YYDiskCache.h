/**
 YYDiskCache is a thread-safe cache that stores key-value pairs backed by SQLite
 and file system (similar to NSURLCache's disk cache).
 
 YYDiskCache has these features:
 
 * It use LRU (least-recently-used) to remove objects.
 * It can be controlled by cost, count, and age.
 * It can be configured to automatically evict objects when there's no free disk space.
 * It can automatically decide the storage type (sqlite/file) for each object to get
      better performance.
 
 You may compile the latest version of sqlite and ignore the libsqlite3.dylib in
 iOS system to get 2x~4x speed up.
