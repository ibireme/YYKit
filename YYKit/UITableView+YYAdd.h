 Perform a series of method calls that insert, delete, or select rows and

 @discussion Perform a series of method calls that insert, delete, or select
             rows and sections of the table. Call this method if you want
             subsequent insertions, deletion, and selection operations (for
             example, cellForRowAtIndexPath: and indexPathsForVisibleRows)
             to be animated simultaneously.
 
 @discussion If you do not make the insertion, deletion, and selection calls
             inside this block, table attributes such as row count might become
             invalid. You should not call reloadData within the block; if you
             call this method within the group, you will need to perform any
             animations yourself.

                        receiving table view (top, middle, bottom) for row when 
                        scrolling concludes.
